# Hybrid-Feature-Selection-Pipeline
Text classification is one of the significant fields in NLP. It has numerous applications in the business world such as email spam filtering, fraud detection, recruitment and various other tasks. 
The past three decades have witnessed an exponential rise in the amount of information. This has made Text classification all the more challenging. There is a greater need for optimal feature subset selection which in turn enhances classification performance. 
In this project, we discuss a two-stage feature selection pipeline which combines conventional filter methods (Chi Square and Information Gain) with evolutionary algorithm (Genetic Algorithm). 
Subsequently, we aim to compare the results from these pipelines with the results from evolutionary algorithms over existing classifiers. 
The experiments is performed on IMDB Reviews. 
Results obtained show that the pipeline-based feature selection methods perform better than their respective wrapper methods.
